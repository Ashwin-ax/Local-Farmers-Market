## Notes for Beginners

- This project uses vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks required)
- The market data is stored directly in the JavaScript file for simplicity. In a real application, this data would come from a database or API
- The images are placeholders from Unsplash
- The map functionality is represented as a placeholder. In a real application, you would integrate with a mapping API like Google Maps or Mapbox
